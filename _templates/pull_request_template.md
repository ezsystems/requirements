# Pull Request Template

When giving your Pull Request (PR) a Title and Description, be verbose, precise,
and descriptive.

Reference any relevant issues in GitHub and/or JIRA with links.

Be sure that your PR is aiming at the branch that represents the version you
wish to affect. (e.g., Don't send a PR to master if you intend to target v2.0.)

Don't sweat the small stuff. You can always edit what you write, and other
GitHub users will quickly alert you if that is necessary to add detail or answer
any questions or points of confusion.
