# \_templates Folder Contents

The files in this folder are templates: starting points for you to create a
new requirements, Use Cases, or Pull Requests.

# Usage

Example: To create a new feature requirements doc, copy the contents of the
feature_requirements_template.md file, save it in the folder related to the
feature (e.g., `/eZ Platform/PlatformUI/`), and modify its example content to
reflect your desired/proposed features.

Be sure to do this in your own branch, named something useful. Be sure you made
your own branch from the ezsystems/requirements branch representing the version
of eZ Platform you're targeting. For example, make your branch based on the
v2.0 branch if you're contributing requirements to a feature for eZ Platform
version 2.
