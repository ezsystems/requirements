# Developer Experience (DevEx or DX)

eZ Systems has a rich history of supporting developers's needs and desires, and
coming to the table from a perspective of prioritizing the best possible DX.

First and foremost, eZ Platform is a Content Management System. The focus of any
efforts should centralize around the ultimate goal of managing content, and
supporting the use cases that users and developers bring to the table in this
arena.

Second, eZ Platform is a _PHP_ CMS. While the REST API can be used by any
language, the product itself is written in PHP.

Third, eZ Platform is a _Symfony Full Stack Framework_ product. Symfony is a
well-rounded framework providing a wealth of resources to developers to begin
with.

Because _development_ involves a whole lot more than just programming, a
complete picture of the developer experience will include environmental factors
that address the questions:

- How do I write tests?
- How do I set up an environment?
- How do I deploy?
- Where can I learn more?
- How do I automate frequent tasks?
- How do I share things that I'm working on with others?
- How do I stay organized?
- How can I save time?

Among others, these questions are addressed within the requirements collected
within the DX folder here.
